# Introduction

The digital marketing plan for [RogueFitness.com](roguefitness.com) aims to maximize ROAS and prioritize channels and marketing efforts that bring in the highest revenue. To increase ROAS from 8.8 to 10:

-   The budget allocated to loyalty building remains the same at 29%.

-   The budget for demand generation is reduced to 3%, down from 9%.

-   The budget allocated to demand harvesting is increased to 68%, from 62%.

    | Funnel Stage      | Budget | Revenue | Budget % | ROAS |
    |-------------------|--------|---------|----------|------|
    | Demand generation |        |         |          |      |
    | Demand harvesting |        |         |          |      |
    | Loyalty building  |        |         |          |      |
    | TOTAL             |        |         |          |      |

    : Monthly budget and revenue per funnel stage

## SEO

The cost of hiring a new SEO specialist is the biggest expenditure in scaling SEO. Based on the exceptional ROAS (22.6) we see in demand harvesting content, we will hire a second SEO specialist with 10.000 USD[^1].

### Budget Allocation

::: panel-tabset
## Demand Generation

ROAS is positive yet on the lower end at 200%. It wouldn't make sense to hire a new SEO specialist specifically for this or further divide our existing specialist's time and energy for it. So even though we are getting a second specialist, the time and effort going into demand generation will remain the same.Â 

## Demand Harvesting

ROAS is the highest among demand harvesting efforts at 2260%. We can hire a second SEO specialist with 10000 USD who will focus solely on Demand Harvesting and produce and optimize more content, increase rankings and the number of keywords we are focusing on.

### Keyword Analysis

To identify SEO opportunities, we use Search Console. Currently, Rogue Fitness shows up on the second page of the SERP for 14 keywords.

```{r}
ranking <- readxl::read_xlsx("ranking.xlsx") #read file in the same working directory

#install.packages("tidyverse")

library(tidyverse)
filtered_ranking <- ranking %>%
  filter(Position > 10 & Position < 20 ) %>% #filter for the results in second page of SERP
   arrange(desc(Impressions)) #sort by most searched
  
filtered_ranking
```
